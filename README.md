### GM10-51: The Fundamental Scale of Cosmic Architecture  
Redefining Physical Constants and Natural Units — Mechanics of Infinity  
_By Jamil Al Thani & Grace Cisneros_

## 🧬 What is this project?

This repository contains the scientific foundation and public documents related to the **GM10-51 scale**, a fundamental physical constant that redefines the fabric of the universe at all scales—from quantum to cosmic—based on the **D10Z Universal Fractal Law**:

> `F = f · v(Zn)`

Where:
- `Zn = 10⁻⁵¹ m` is the **GM scale**, the base of the *Big Start* model (non-singular cosmogenesis).
- `f` is the scale-resonant natural frequency.
- `v(Zn)` is the omnidimensional fractal vibration.

This model challenges and replaces the standard Big Bang framework (ΛCDM) and introduces:
- No need for dark matter or dark energy
- Unified explanation across 73 orders of magnitude
- Verified predictions with **R² > 0.97** (JWST, ALMA, DESI 2024)
